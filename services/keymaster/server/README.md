# MDIP Keymaster REST API server

The Keymaster service exposes the Keymaster client library as a REST API.
This is necessary if the client is written is a programming language other than Javascript or Typescript, such as python.
This service also used when clients share a wallet, such as the `kc` CLI and MDIP mediators running on an MDIP server node.
