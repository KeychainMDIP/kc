### Search Server

**search-server** is a Node service that connects to a Gatekeeper instance, fetches newly updated DIDs, and stores the associated DID documents in a local database. It exposes HTTP endpoints for returning a DID document from a DID or text based queries against the DID documents, returning lists of DIDs that match.

### Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Configuration

Copy the provided environment sample and configure the necessary variables:

```bash
cp sample.env .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file to set your desired configuration:

```env
# The port the server will run on
SEARCH_SERVER_PORT=3001

# URL where your Gatekeeper service is running
SEARCH_SERVER_GATEKEEPER_URL=http://localhost:4224

# How often (in ms) to poll Gatekeeper for new or updated DIDs.
SEARCH_SERVER_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS=60000
```
