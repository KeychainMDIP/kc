![Identities screen](identities-screen.png)

This screen offers the following functionality:

1. CREATE: Creates a new agent DID and registers the document to the user-selected registry.
1. REMOVE: Removes an agent DID from the user's local wallet.
1. BACKUP: Backup an agent DID to an encrypted DID Vault. Recovery is later possible using only wallet keys & a DID identifier.
1. RECOVER: Recovers an Agent DID from its DID Identifier. This will recover the latest Agent DID backup stored in the encrypted DID Vault.
