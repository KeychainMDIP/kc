This section contains basic instructions to familiarize you with the use of MDIP's Keymaster WebUI.

The Keymaster WebUI is a client interface to the MDIP Keymaster Library<!--Add link when library docs are written-->, available in the `kc` repository. The WebUI is not intended to be a commercial wallet; it is a reference implementation of an MDIP wallet offering a web (React) user interface to the MDIP Keymaster library.

Wallet creation and MDIP key operations are performed client-side. The server-side is running an MDIP Gatekeeper server, which exposes the Keymaster WebUI server components on port `4224`.

An online version of the MDIP Keymaster WebUI is available here: https://mdip.keychain.org/
