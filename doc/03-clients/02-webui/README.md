This section contains basic instructions to familiarize you with the use of MDIP's Keymaster web UI.

The Keymaster WebUI is a client interface to the MDIP Keymaster library<!--Add link when library docs are written-->, available in the [`kc` repository](https://github.com/keychainMDIP/kc). The web UI is not intended to be a commercial wallet; it is a reference implementation of an MDIP wallet offering a web (React) user interface.

Wallet creation and MDIP key operations are performed client-side. The server-side is running an MDIP Gatekeeper server, which exposes the Keymaster WebUI server components on port `4224`.

An online version of the MDIP Keymaster WebUI is available here: https://mdip.keychain.org/
