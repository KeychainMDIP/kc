This section contains basic instructions to familiarize you with the use of MDIP's Keymaster WebUI.

The Keymaster WebUI is a client interface to the MDIP Keymaster library. The web UI is not intended to be a commercial wallet; it is a reference implementation of an MDIP wallet offering a web (React) user interface.

Wallet creation and MDIP key operations are performed client-side. The server-side is running an MDIP Gatekeeper server, which exposes the Keymaster WebUI server components on port `4224`.

When operating a local MDIP node, the MDIP Keymaster WebUI is available at http://localhost:4224/
