# kc

Keychain (kc) is the reference implementation of the Multi Dimensional Identity Protocol ([MDIP](/docs/mdip/scheme)).
Details on each command can be found in the [CLI User Manual](https://keychain.org/docs/keychain/clients/cli/) and the [Keymaster WebUI User Manual](https://keychain.org/docs/keychain/clients/webui/).

## Quick start

Recommended system requirements:
- GNU/Linux OS with [docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerized operation
- node 18.18.2 and npm 9.8.1 or newer for manual and local operation
- minimum of 8Gb RAM if operating a full trustless node

```
$ git clone https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc
$ cd kc
$ cp sample.env .env
$ ./start-node
```
## Node configuration

Customize your node in the kc/.env file.

```
KC_UID=1000                                        # Docker host UID
KC_GID=1002                                        # Docker host GID
KC_NODE_NAME=anon                                  # Hyperswarm node name
KC_NODE_ID=anon                                    # Node Keymaster DID name
KC_GATEKEEPER_REGISTRIES=hyperswarm,TBTC,TFTC      # Supported DID Registries
...
{adjust registry details for advanced users only}
```

Once your node is operational (start-node), you can setup local dependencies and manage your server using local CLI wallet and other command line tools:

```
$ npm ci                                     # Installs all node package dependencies
$ ./kc -h                                    # Displays kc CLI help
$ ./kc create-id anon TBTC                   # Creates Node Keymaster DID name (set as KC_NODE_ID in .env)
$ ./scripts/tbtc-cli createwallet mdip       # Creates MDIP wallet for Bitcoin Testnet registry
$ ./scripts/tbtc-cli getnewaddress           # Get a new address to fund Bitcoin Testnet wallet
$ ./scripts/tbtc-cli getwalletinfo           # Get a general status of confirmed and incoming funds
```

## Command line interface wallet
Use the CLI `./kc` or the web app at http://localhost:4226 to access the server-side wallet.
Use the web app at http://localhost:4224 to access a client-side (browser) wallet.
