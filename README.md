# kc

Keychain (kc) is the reference implementation of the Multi Dimensional Identity Protocol ([MDIP](/docs/mdip/scheme)).
Details on each command can be found in the [CLI User Manual](https://keychain.org/docs/keychain/clients/cli/) and the [Keymaster WebUI User Manual](https://keychain.org/docs/keychain/clients/webui/).

## Quick start

Recommended system requirements:

- GNU/Linux OS with [docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerized operation
- node 18.18.2 and npm 9.8.1 or newer for manual and local operation
- minimum of 8Gb RAM if operating a full trustless node

```
$ git clone https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc
$ cd kc
$ cp sample.env .env
$ ./start-node
```

### Local Development (for developers)

If you're developing or working on Keychain follow these additional steps after cloning.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Overview

A Keychain MDIP node includes several interoperating microservices. If you follow the dependency arrows on the diagram below, you will end up at the central core service, the [Gatekeeper service](services/gatekeeper/server/README.md) responsible for maintaining the integrity of the local DID database. The mediators are responsible for connecting the Gatekeeper to various networks such as [Hyperswarm](services/mediators/hyperswarm/README.md). The TBTC (testnet Bitcoin) and TFTC (testnet Feathercoin) mediators are both instances of the [Satoshi mediator](services/mediators/satoshi/README.md) since they are derived from Bitcoin core (they differ only in how they are configured). [Keymaster](packages/keymaster/README.md) is the MDIP client responsible for holding the private keys and signing DID operations (create, update, delete) sent to Gatekeeper. The [browser web wallet](services/gatekeeper/client/README.md), [browser extension](browser/chrome-extension/README.md), and [Keymaster service](services/keymaster/server/README.md) all use the [Keymaster library](packages/keymaster/README.md). The [server web wallet](services/keymaster/client/README.md) is the same as the browser web wallet, except it is configured to talk to the Keymaster service instead of hosting its own wallet. It uses the same [KeymasterClient](packages/keymaster/src/keymaster-sdk.ts) as the kc CLI. There are two CLI (command line interface) components: [kc](scripts/keychain-cli.js) for talking to the Keymaster service, and [admin](scripts/admin-cli.js) for talking to the Gatekeeper service. The admin script uses the same [GatekeeperClient](packages/gatekeeper/README.md) as the Keymaster service and the mediators.

## Node configuration

Customize your node in the kc/.env file. Environment variables are documented for each service in the READMEs linked in the Overview above.

```
KC_UID=1000                                        # Docker host UID
KC_GID=1002                                        # Docker host GID
KC_NODE_NAME=anon                                  # Hyperswarm node name
KC_NODE_ID=anon                                    # Node Keymaster DID name
KC_GATEKEEPER_REGISTRIES=hyperswarm,TBTC,TFTC      # Supported DID Registries
...
{adjust registry details for advanced users only}
```

Once your node is operational (start-node), you can setup local dependencies and manage your server using local CLI wallet and other command line tools:

```
$ npm ci                                     # Installs all node package dependencies
$ ./kc -h                                    # Displays kc CLI help
$ ./kc create-id anon TBTC                   # Creates Node Keymaster DID name (set as KC_NODE_ID in .env)
$ ./scripts/tbtc-cli createwallet mdip       # Creates MDIP wallet for Bitcoin Testnet registry
$ ./scripts/tbtc-cli getnewaddress           # Get a new address to fund Bitcoin Testnet wallet
$ ./scripts/tbtc-cli getwalletinfo           # Get a general status of confirmed and incoming funds
```

## Command line interface wallet

Use the CLI `./kc` or the web app at http://localhost:4226 to access the server-side wallet.
Use the web app at http://localhost:4224 to access a client-side (browser) wallet.
